	"aboutUsDescription2": "In 2013, due to the country's development plans and emphasis on privatization, the production and distribution of plant pesticides (which had previously been a monopoly of the Ministry of Agriculture) was transferred to the private sector and domestic producers, and this created a competitive market in the country between pesticide manufacturing enterprises, and led to an increase in the quality of products, including our products. The increase and growth in sales of our products in recent years shows Aria Chemical's ability to compete in the industry.",
